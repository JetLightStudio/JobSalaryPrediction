# JobSalaryPrediction
Going over ML.NET by creating a very simple application for it to train against some data, how to evaluate the model, and then how to predict on new data.

# Purpose
When you think of data science and machine learning two programming languages are going to instantly pop into your mind: Python and R. These two languages are great and I love working with them, but coming from a .NET and C# background myself it would be nice to see some love for data science in the C# world. Well, now we have it with the announcement of ML.NET we can do just that!
